##This project is a **Real-Time Chat Application** built using **React.js** and **WebSockets**. It allows users to enter their name and instantly join a chat interface where they can send and receive messages in real time. The application uses a public WebSocket server (`wss://echo.websocket.events`) to simulate two-way communication, reflecting sent messages as if they were received from another user. The interface is fully responsive and styled with custom CSS, offering a smooth user experience across devices. Key features include a username login screen, live message updates, automatic scrolling, and message differentiation (user vs. bot). This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of real-time web communication, state management with React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), and integration with third-party WebSocket services, making it an ideal beginner-to-intermediate level frontend project.
